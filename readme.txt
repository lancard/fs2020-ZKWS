To install: place both folders in your flight sim Community folder. zkwsaerial is the satellite imagery and 
zkwskalma is the airport scenery itself (i.e. runways, taxiways etc.). The aerial scenery is recommended but 
optional.

About: The default version of this airport in Microsoft Flight Simulator is at least 7 years out of date, so I 
have updated it to more or less how it should appear as of 2019. Unfortunately all buildings are generic as I 
have no 3D modelling experience. If anyone is interested in helping me make custom buildings, please contact me.

Kalma is an airport in Wonsan, North Korea. It was initially a military airport and has been completely overhauled
and turned into a joint-use international airport, with a new international terminal opening in 2015. The Wonsan
Air Festival took place at Kalma in 2016. Despite it being a large international airport capable of housing up 
to 12 commercial airliners at a time, the airport has remained relatively dormant, with only 2 known 
international flights and one domestic charter.
